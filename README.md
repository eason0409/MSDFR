Trajectory anomaly detection is one of the key data mining technologies in cloud-edge collaborative intelligent border security scenarios. Existing trajectory anomaly detec-tion methods suffer from limitations such as inherent design flaws in the detectors and insufficient feature representation capabilities of trajectories. To address these issues, this paper proposes a trajectory anomaly detection algorithm based on multi-sector di-vision feature representation(MSDFR). This method involves dividing the longi-tude-latitude plane into sectors of equal angles for variable-length trajectory data. It then extracts trajectory features by calculating the distance between trajectory points and the central point within each sector, along with the polar coordinate angular offset. Finally, an unsupervised algorithm is applied to detect anomalous trajectories. Exper-imental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively identify anomalous trajectory data, and the extracted trajectory features can be generalized to various tra-jectory mining tasks.
